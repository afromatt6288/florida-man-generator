      "Article": "GOLDEN, Colo. >> A cat who wandered away from his new home in Florida has been reunited with his owner after being found nearly 2,000 miles away in Colorado. Waylon, an orange-striped tabby cat, was reunited with Daniel Johns on Wednesday at the Foothills Animal Shelter in Golden. The cat went missing from the Naples, Fla., area in June, disappearing within an hour after Johns adopted the stray. Waylon apparently fled through a hole in a dryer vent. Last month, a woman in a Denver suburb noticed him hanging around as she walked her dog and brought him to the shelter. A microchip linked the cat to Johns. It's not known how the cat made its way to Colorado. One of the shelter's theories is that snowbirds may have taken the cat home with them.",

      "Article": "A Florida Man denied ownership of three syringes removed from his rectum during a 4:30 AM strip search at a county jail, according to a criminal complaint. Cops arrested Wesley Scott, 40, early Friday on an outstanding warrant charging him with drug possession. While being searched in the field, Scott denied having any illegal items concealed on (or in) his body. But when Scott, seen at right, arrived at the Pinellas County jail and was subjected to a strip search, he \"removed three syringes from his rectum and provided them\" to a jailer. Scott then claimed that he \"found\" the syringes and that \"they were not his.\" This explanation did not stop officials from charging Scott with introducing contraband into a correctional facility, a felony. He is being held on a $5000 bond. The court filing does not reveal whether Scott named the purpoprted owner of the syringes that had been found in his rectum. Or whether that individual had consented to his works being stored in such a facility.",

A deputy called to diffuse the situation said Lagana was \"being loud and argumentative\" to patrons at the flea market and \"appeared heavily intoxicated.\" Lagana was booked into jail on the misdemeanor charge. He was released after posting a $100 bond.",

      "Article": "A Florida man who was searching for a golf ball around a pond was found dead earlier this week. Police rescue teams recovered the body of a 74-year-old golfer, Milo Jazmines, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, at East Lake Woodlands Country Club just 20 miles from Tampa. The incident happened on Sunday. The man hit his tee shot on the third hole and was last seen \"looking for his ball near the green,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. \"Jazmines' golf cart was parked on the cart path and his putter was found lying on the ground near the water.\" Soon after, divers found the man in the pond, not far from where the putter was located. Authorities believe he fell into the water and drowned. Police say his death does not appear suspicious. Friends of Jazmines, who was born and raised in the Philippines, said he liked to search the golf course for lost balls.",

      "Article": "MONROE COUNTY, Fla. - A Florida man who was upset about the noise a chicken was making grabbed the bird and kicked it like \"a football player would kick a field goal,\" according to the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies said 43-year-old Nicholas Kevin Chew's girlfriend called them on March 22 to report that he kicked a chicken while they were arguing and she was worried the bird's leg was broken. Chew reportedly admitted to kicking the chicken out of his way because he was upset with the bird's noises, records show, but it was a separate witness who said the suspect kicked the animal with the same amount of force an athlete would use. The Rhode Island Red chicken named Huhn was found standing nearby on one leg. It was taken to an animal hospital where a veterinarian determined it had suffered four broken ribs, according to a news release. The bird has since been reunited with its owner, who chose to press charges. Chew was arrested Monday on an animal cruelty charge.",

      "image": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546645/bin/cottonmouth__snake.jpg",
      "Article": "A Florida man was bitten in the face by a venomous snake after trying to kiss it, authorities told ABC Tampa affiliate WFTS-TV. Austin Hatfield, 18, of Wimauma, told his friends he took a liking to the snake and decided to keep it as a pet, Robin Belcher, the mother of his best friend, Jason Belcher, told ABC News. \"It was a cottonmouth snake, 4 foot, and he pulled it out of pillow case and laid it on his chest and it ended up striking him on the face,\" Belcher said. The teenager, who is reportedly in critical condition at Tampa General Hospital, did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Family members reportedly killed the reptile and brought it to the hospital. Cottonmouths, also known as water moccasins, are a common snake in the southeast, according to Terry Phillip, the curator of reptiles for Reptile Gardens in Rapid City, South Dakota. Phillip, who is a professional herpetologist, said about 3,500 people in the United States are bitten each year by venomous snakes, leading to as many as four fatalities. About 70 percent of the victims are men between the ages of 16 and 25 and alcohol is usually involved, he said. \"The vast majority of men are bitten in the upper extremities, forearms and face,\" Phillip said. \"Testosterone and snake venom don’t mix real well.\" Cottonmouth bites are rarely deadly but are among the most excruciatingly painful of snake bites, Phillip said. Their venom attacks the red blood cells causing an immediate burning sensation, swelling and redness. If improperly treated, a bite can lead to permanent damage of the nerves, kidneys and heart. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is investigating the incident because Hatfield allegedly did not have a permit to have the snake. He faces possible charges, according to WFTS. Florida requires 1,000 hours of training under the guidance of a licensed expert in order to obtain a permit to handle poisonous snakes, Phillip noted.",

      "Article": "Meet Don Castner. The 39-year-old was one of dozens of Florida residents arrested today on welfare fraud charges. Castner and his codefendants were swept up in \"Operation Meal Ticket,\" an undercover probe run by the Manatee County Sheriff's Office. Castner, who is locked up in lieu of $5000 bond, was charged with felony welfare fraud for allegedly selling Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards to undercover agents. Some suspects used the proceeds of the illegal EBT card sales to purchase drugs and alcohol, according to investigators. As seen above, when Castner was arrested today he was wearing a t-shirt with the message \"Jail Sucks!\" and a drawing of a stripe-wearing inmate behind a set of bars. Castner had to replace the shirt with a blue smock when he was subsequently booked into the county lockup (where he posed for the mug shot at right). Castner's disdain for confined spaces is likely a byproduct of his lengthy rap sheet, which includes collars for burglary; battery; drug possession; contempt of court; assault on a law enforcement officer; and domestic battery by strangulation.",

The wig didn't work, and agents caught up with and arrested Robert \"Bobby\" Walls soon after watching him ride away, deputies said. Walls later admitted he put the wig on in hopes that officers wouldn't recognize him and that he'd avoid arrest, deputies said. Investigators had set up a perimeter around the residence after getting a tip he was there. Walls' warrant was one of over 100 in \"a significant drug investigation\" by the sheriff's office. Walls was charged with conspiracy to possess controlled substance, solicitation to sell controlled substance, and unlawful use of a two-way device. \"So here is the moral of the story,\" the sheriff's office posted on its Facebook page. \"Don't sell drugs and you don't have to worry about going to jail, don't try to hide from Law Enforcement if you have a warrant, and above all else DO NOT wear a hideous wig while trying to run from the Po/Po on a bicycle.\"",

      "Article": "A Florida woman pulled an alligator out of her pants during a traffic stop on Monday - a strange move that might just rank on the state's list of odd reported crimes. Ariel Machan-Le Quire, 25, was in the passenger's seat of a vehicle around 3:30 a.m. in Punta Gorda when she was pulled over, the Miami Herald reported, citing an incident report from the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office. The department said that the woman was asked if she had anything else in the vehicle, and then \"proceeded to pull an alligator out of her yoga pants (about one foot in length) and placed it into the bed of the truck.\" Machan-Le Quire, along with 22-year-old driver Michael Clemons, claimed they were trying to collect wildlife from underneath an overpass. Investigators said the woman also had 41 small turtles inside of a backpack. Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission was called to take over, the sheriff's office said. The state is often known for reports of weird crimes. Just last week, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office caught a fugitive man who thought he could evade capture by wearing a \"hideous\" blonde wig.",

      "Article": "A Florida woman explained to cops that she stabbed her boyfriend after he purposefully passed gas in her general direction. Deborah Ann Burns, 37, told police that she was watching TV Tuesday night in the Immokalee home she shares with Willie Butler, her boyfriend of six years. Burns advised that, at one point, \"Willie walked by her and farted in her face.\" Burns then \"confronted him about the fart and Willie became agitated, telling her to shut up\" according to a Collier County Sheriff's Office report. During the ensuing confrontation, Burns allegedly grabbed an eight-inch kitchen knife and threw it at the 53-year-old Butler, striking him in the stomach. Butler, who suffered a minor laceration, was treated at the scene by EMS personnel. Pictured in the above mug shot, Burns was arrested for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. She was booked into the county jail, where she is being held in lieu of $50,000 bond on the felony count. Burns, a convicted felon, previously spent 21 months in state prison for aggravated assault with a weapon and battery on a law enforcement officer.",

      "Article": "State troopers recently arrested a Florida man who was caught trying to live out his Titanic movie fantasies and make his heart go on atop a moving vehicle. Local news affiliates report that authorities arrested Leonard Olsen, 70, after an off-duty deputy for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department caught him on video, attempting to \"surf\" his Cadillac while traveling on the highway with cruise control enabled.The deputy first noticed Olsen's Cadillac doing more than 100 miles per hour when it abruptly slowed down to just 40 mph. Then, Olsen supposedly opened the sunroof and propped himself up on top of his moving car while traveling on Interstate 4 in the westbound lane. This prompted the officer to begin recording video on his smartphone. Following the event, the deputy called in for on-duty reinforcements, to which Florida Highway Patrol responded. Olsen was pulled over just a few minutes later at the intersection of US-98 and Wedgewood Estates Boulevard. \"I thought it would be a nice way to praise God for a minute, and I thought it would be nice at the time and that's what I did,\" Olsen supposedly said in his testimony, according to the Florida Highway Patrol's arrest report. When Olsen was apprehended, he was quoted saying that he'd rather go to jail than go back to his home. \"My wife treats me like a servant and she's the mistress,\" Olsen continued. \"Lock me up, I'd rather go to jail than go back home.\" Olsen was charged with reckless driving and booked at Polk County Jail with a $21,000 bond.",

      "Article": "PINELLAS PARK, Fla. (TCD) - Police arrested a 34-year-old man on Wednesday, May 19, a day after a road-rage shooting incident that left another man with a leg injury. According to the Pinellas Park Police Department, Robert Lewis and Peter Sala Jr. got into a verbal altercation while they were both driving south on U.S. Highway 19 on May 18. Police said Sala drove past Lewis's car and reportedly \"threw what is believed to be a portion of a banana.\" The banana hit the side of Lewis's pickup truck. Police said after the banana hit the truck, Lewis allegedly fired his handgun at Sala's truck. The bullet shattered the passenger window, and \"entered and lodged into the front passenger dashboard area.\" Sala suffered a \"non-life-threatening laceration to his leg\" from a piece of glass. Police determined the shooting was a road rage incident. Lewis met with detectives Wednesday morning, and was then charged with shooting a deadly missile into/at an occupied vehicle and criminal mischief.

      "Article": "A Florida man has been arrested for allegedly attacking his daughter with pizza after she said that she wanted to be alone. On the afternoon of Sunday, May 23, Tyler Worden, 41, visited the Vero Beach home of his 20-year-old daughter, Kristin Worden. He brought a pizza for them to eat together, but she told him that she wasn't feeling well and asked him to leave, according to an arrest affidavit. The daughter told police that her father became angry and refused to leave. He allegedly argued with her in the doorway of her home. She said he then allegedly began to throw slices of pizza at her, hitting her in the face. The daughter began to yell at her father and called 911 police after he allegedly refused to leave, police said. When Officer Jonathan Lozada from the Vero Beach Police Department responded to the woman's call, he discovered tomato sauce on her face. Lozada also found pizza toppings covering the entryway of the woman's house. The police officer interviewed the woman's father, who claimed that he only threw the pizza after he thought she had closed her front door. But Lozada did not believe his claim. The father's physical location during the argument and the woman's outward swinging front door led Lozada to conclude \"there is no way that Tyler could not have seen that the door was open when he threw the pizza.\" Lozada also noted the \"strong odor of an alcoholic beverage\" on the father's breath. He arrested Tyler Worden on a misdemeanor charge and booked him into the Indian River County Jail.",

      "Article": "A family packing their car for a trip to a local water park was terrorized Sunday by a man waving a 9mm handgun who had earlier summoned deputies saying he was an undercover CIA operative. The sheriff's office said they responded to a call shortly after 9 a.m. Sunday asking for agency assistance at a Lehigh Acres address from a caller who identified himself as an undercover CIA agent and needed help with a drug buy. The caller told sheriff's dispatchers that he was at an Otto Avenue North home to make a drug buy/bust and that he would apprehend the suspect and deputies could make the arrest. Deputies found the man, Metlz Celestin, 18, of Lehigh Acres standing near a car at a home. Deputies had been told Celestin had a handgun and they found a 9mm firearm with one round chambered and five in a magazine in the pocket of his jacket. A small plastic baggie with about 8 grams of suspected marijuana was also found in Celestin' car. Five people at the home on Otto Street told deputies that they were packing their car for a trip to Sun Splash Family Waterpark in Cape Coral when Celestin drove into their driveway in a green Toyota. The victims told deputies that Celestin identified himself as undercover CIA and then pulled a gun on them, threatened to shoot them and forced some of them to their knees. All of the victims said they were afraid for their lives during the incident with Celestin pointing the gun constantly at them. One of the victims shielded his pregnant wife and began shouting at Celestin to put the gun down. Celestin was arrested and charged with five counts of aggravated assault with a weapon, carrying a concealed weapon and possession of marijuana. Celestin has several previous convictions in Lee County ranging from trespassing to battery.",

      "Article": "As diners at a McDonald's in Florida enjoyed their Big Macs, a 62-year-old man removed his clothes and performed a \"strange dance\" before apparently \"trying to have relations with a railing,\" according to a police report. Investigators say that John Morgan was arrested Sunday after his impromptu 7:30 PM performance at the restaurant in Collier County. Charged with trespassing, the homeless Morgan was booked into the county jail on the misdemeanor count. He is scheduled for arraignment on July 3. Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to the McDonald's due to a report of \"Male taking clothes off doing a strange dance, subject possibly on drugs.\" A 911 caller also reported that \"it looked as though the male was trying to have relations with a railing.\" When cops arrived at the restaurant, they encountered Morgan, a regular guest at the county jail who had \"been trespassed from this McDonald's for a previous disturbance he had caused.\" Picture above, Morgan, who performed his dance near the McDonald's front door, has a long rap sheet, with collars for battery; disturbing the peace; trespass; carrying an open container; and disorderly intoxication.",

The shooting was never reported. On July 3, Rocquel's mother, Susan Priser, escaped from the home and ran into the woods, but fell and hurt herself. Susan was taken to the hospital and treated. On Thursday, Susan asked deputies to check on her husband, Rocky. When deputies arrived at the home, Rocquel was barricaded inside. After two hours, deputies entered the home and arrested Rocquel. They found her father's body wrapped in a cloth. Nearby neighbors were shocked to hear the news. \"Especially for it to be this close, you know, it's an eye-opener. Who can you trust, you know what I mean? There's good people and bad people, but how do we know?\" said Dylan Singletary. Priser has been charged with her father's murder and a judge has set her bond at $500,000.",

Jesus Oscar Ferrer Jr., 30, attacked his girlfriend - with whom he has a child - in the couple's motel room in Tampa, police said. A struggle ensued and Ferrer allegedly pinned his girlfriend to the ground. He \"placed his palm on her face and pressed her head into the ground using his body weight,\" which prompted the woman to rip off part of his beard, the complaint said. By the time officers arrived, Ferrer had fled the motel, according to the complaint. He was arrested and booked into the Pasco County jail on a charge of felony battery. He made his initial court appearance Monday, according to the Smoking Gun. Ferrer was charged with battery earlier this year involving the same woman at another motel, the report said. He pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge, was sentenced to time served, and paid $750 in fines and court costs, according to the report.",

Fireworks are a very important part of American culture, especially during Independence Day, where we celebrate the removal of all the Brits or something like that. I don't know, my history classes were in Florida and my teachers just drank whiskey and let us do whatever. Brevard County Fire Rescue crews reported that he had two fingers missing, blown clean the fuck off. Around 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday, the Florida man was airlifted to Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, Florida. His name was not released, but Click Orlando states the incident happened on Ligustrum Lane and he's in his early 20’s. Last year in the colonies known as The United States of America, or The Divided States of Embarrassment, 13,000 injuries were sustained from fireworks, according to the Brevard Times.",

Jason Stoll, 47, is charged with felony battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer without violence. Around 12 a.m. Saturday, a St. Petersburg police officer told Stoll he could no longer sell hot dogs in the roadway after his street closure permit ended, according to court documents obtained by WFLA. An officer asked Stoll to close up shop, but he continued to try selling a hot dog, the court documents say. Stoll became frustrated and threw a hot dog at the officer, who was in full uniform at the time of the incident, according to the station. Stoll, who lives in New Port Richey, was booked into the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. Online court records show he is out after posting $2,500 bail. The court records note he has many tattoos, including the phrases \"hustle eat sleep repeat,\" and \"what doesn't kill me makes me stronger,\" among many others.",

      "Article": "A Florida man who tussled with a cop trying to arrest him for disorderly conduct later said that he \"really enjoyed resisting\" because it was like being on \"Live PD,\" a cable program that chronicles the mayhem police officers encounter on the night shift. A patrolman was dispatched yesterday to a home in Sebastian, a city near Vero Beach, after a 911 caller reported that a man wielding a golf club was chasing a woman. When an officer arrived on the scene, he encountered Rudolph Grant, 53, who smelled of booze and was screaming and cursing in front of the residence. After trying to walk away, Grant struggled as the cop sought to handcuff him, according to an arrest affidavit. Grant, the cop noted, tried to pull away from him, \"tensed his arms with an attempt to get away from me,\" and finally \"made his body go limp.\" Due to his \"erratic behavior,\" Grant was subsequently placed in \"mechanical restraints that were double-locked.\" Before being placed into a squad car, Grant told the arresting officer that he \"really enjoyed resisting. It was like being on Live PD.\" The A&E program, a \"Cops\" progeny, bills itself as a documentary series covering \"DUI checkpoint stops to high-speed chases, bar fights to gang shootings, domestic disputes to drug busts.\" Grant, seen above, was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors. He was released from the Indian River county jail after posting $1000 bond and is scheduled for a July 31 court hearing. Grant's rap sheet includes a felony cocaine possession conviction.",

(WGNO) - A Florida woman led deputies on a high-speed chase this morning after she went into the Covington Kia Dealership, pretended to be a manager and started \"firing\" employees. According to a news release from the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office, deputies responded about 9 a.m. to the Kia Dealership, where 21-year-old Mila Ellis was said to be acting erratic. Ellis, of Hialeah, Florida, went into the business, pretended she was a manager and started to fire people. Employees called the sheriff's office in response to her behavior. Deputies asked Ellis to leave the business and to not return. As she was leaving, the sheriff's office says, deputies ran the license plate and found that the Honda Accord she was driving was reported stolen from Broward County, Florida. When deputies tried to stop Ellis, she placed her vehicle in reverse, tried to run over a deputy, then fled on I-12 toward Slidell. Ellis rammed two police vehicles during the chase, which ended on Airport Road in Slidell after Ellis drove into a ditch. Ellis was arrested and booked into the St. Tammany Parish Jail on two counts of aggravated criminal damage, aggravated flight from an officer, attempted murder of a police officer, possession of stolen property and disturbing the peace.",

      "Article": "MIAMI (CBSMiami/CNN) - The grim reaper is back and spreading his message once again. The Florida man who visits the state's reopened beaches dressed as death itself wants Gov. Ron DeSantis to require the public to wear masks as the state continues to see a spike in positive COVID-19 cases. Daniel Uhlfelder, a lawyer who sued the state's Republican governor earlier this year saying he prematurely opened beaches, has spent the last several weeks warning beachgoers of the coronavirus's rising danger while dressed as the Grim Reaper -- complete with a dark cloak and a giant scythe. \"Unfortunately, when I started this work in March, I had a bad belief that this was going to get really bad. Unfortunately, my predictions have exceeded what I thought,\" Uhlfelder -- this time dressed in a light blue shirt and pink tie -- told CNN on Monday. Criticizing DeSantis for leaving decisions like masks and beach access up to local officials, Uhlfelder said, \"he needs to issue a mask order because masks work.\" \"Local officials have instituted mask mandates in their respective counties, including Miami Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Orange, Hillsborough and Duval. These are Florida's largest counties, therefore most of the state's population is under a mask mandate,\" Cody McCloud, press secretary to Gov. DeSantis told CNN. \"Some counties have experienced significant cases of COVID-19 and others relatively few, which is why the input from municipal leaders is important to determine the best course of action for a particular community. A mask mandate may make sense in Miami-Dade County, but not in Florida's more than 20 rural counties, some with fewer than 50 COVID-positive cases.\" DeSantis said earlier on Monday that the state's high positivity rates are in part due to an increase in the number of tests done throughout the state. He went on to say that the median age of everybody testing positive right now is 36 and that barring comorbidities the \"fatality rate is pretty close to zero.\" Florida is now reporting 7,361 new cases of COVID-19, according to the Florida Department of Health. This brings the state's total to 213,794 cases and 3,841 deaths, the health department reported July 7. The costumed attorney says he is targeting beaches because they are drawing people into the state from around the world, which is in part resulting in increased case numbers. Since the beginning of his tour on May 1, Uhlfelder has traveled to beaches from Miami to Jacksonville, receiving at least some push back from beachgoers. \"Coming out here and dressed as the grim reaper, you know, saying 'You're dead for being out here,' I think that's a little bit much,\" beachgoer James Rivera told CNN at Jacksonville Beach. \"Let's not give everything up because we're sick. As crazy as that sounds, it's a bit too much.\" Regardless of the opposition, however, Uhlfelder has continued his tour in hopes of being \"a voice for the people of Florida.\" He says his main concern is not necessarily Floridian beachgoers, but rather the tourists who come from out of state. \"It's not necessarily the act of being on the beach,\" says Uhlfelder. \"They're getting fresh air, they're exercising, and I don't have a problem with that type of conduct. It's the fact that people come to Florida to come to use our beaches.\" His worry is that small towns, like his own in Escambia County, may not have sufficient infrastructure to support the surge in cases of coronavirus. The solution, he says, is statewide guidance such as the desired mask order. \"We don't have a comprehensive state plan to deal with this,\" he says. \"The governor has decided to defer to the local areas, like cities and counties, to make the decisions, which are tough decisions.\"",

Jarvis Dorsey, 33, was collared by St. Petersburg patrolmen responding to a 911 call about a man with a gun. After chasing Dorsey through a series of backyards, cops tackled the suspect and placed him in handcuffs. During the pursuit, cops report, Dorsey discarded a loaded firearm. During a subsequent search of Dorsey, officers located painkillers in a pill bottle, a discovery that prompted the suspect to spontaneously offer up a description of his occupation. \"I’m just a small time drug dealer trying to make a dollar,\" said Dorsey, who is nicknamed \"Jig.\" That explanation, as it were, did not keep cops from charging Dorsey with narcotics possession, resisting an officer, and weapons possession. The Largo resident is locked up in lieu of $26,000 bond. Dorsey's rap sheet shows that his criminal repertoire exceeds that of a \"small time drug dealer.\" He has been busted for battery; marijuana possession; disorderly intoxication; aggravated assault; armed burglary; domestic battery; narcotics possession; and assault on a law enforcement officer.

Indian River County sheriff's officials went to a McDonald's in the 700 block of South U.S. 1 in Vero Beach for a possible disturbance. A woman said a vehicle behind her in the drive-thru kept striking her rear bumper. She pointed to a vehicle driven by Stevens, 69, of Vero Beach. Stevens said he's never had a valid Florida driver's license. Deputies noticed he did have an open bottle of liquor in a brown paper bag in the passenger seat. Stevens smelled of booze, saying he felt \"pretty good.\" He said he was drinking Jim Beam bourbon from the bottle in the passenger seat. He said he was drinking at \"stop signs.\" \"He further explained that he was not drinking while the car was moving and only when he stopped for stop signs and traffic signals,\" the affidavit states. He said he imbibed \"actively\" from Port St. Lucie to Indian River County. Lots of stop signs and traffic signals are between Port St. Lucie and Indian River County. Stevens participated in field sobriety exercises and was arrested on charges of DUI and driving without a license. At the Indian River County Jail, breath tests measured Stevens's blood alcohol content at 0.153 and 0.147 – greater than the 0.08 legal limit. Stevens said he'd had two earlier DUI charges from Missouri.",

The sheriff's office arrested Jesse Hill, 42, of Altoona on July 8, in connection with the death of Ernie Wilburn on May 4. Deputies said Hill shot Wilburn with a pellet rifle because Wilburn had been locked out of the residence and was yelling for Hill to let him in. A witness, Hill's girlfriend, told deputies that Wilburn was annoying them, so Hill shot Wilburn with a pellet gun through the bedroom window. When deputies arrived at the house to investigate, they found Wilburn dead on the living room floor, covered with a sheet and with furniture pillows piled on top of it. Deputies said it was clear the body had been moved because of the location of the blood-like stain on the floor. Deputies also added that when they read the search warrant, Hill asked if it included a particular area of the property. Deputies said it did, and when they searched in that area, they found the Ruger .22 caliber air rifle. According to an arrest affidavit, Hill claimed he didn't know the pellet rifle could kill Wilburn, but the property owner said he had scolded Hill for shooting the rifle inside the residence, where it passed through several wall panels, meaning Hill knew the damage the rifle could do. Hill briefly disappeared, according to deputies, after May 4, telling people he was \"wanted for murder\" even though law enforcement never told him that. He was eventually found and arrested. Hill faces a charge of manslaughter.",

Jonathan Crenshaw, 46, has been accused of assaulting 22-year-old Cesar Coronado with a pair of scissors. The artist is said to have picked up the tool using his feet and stabbed the tourist in his left arm, according to statements Mr Coronado and his friend provided to the Miami Beach police department. Mr Crenshaw has been charged with aggravated battery using a deadly weapon. He claims Mr Coronado was the one who attacked him, however. According to Mr Crenshaw, the tourist walked up to him as he was sleeping and punched him the face, causing him to act in self-defence. He currently remains in jail while awaiting trial. Police found the victim lying on the ground in Collins Avenue, a popular destination for tourists. He was bleeding from the arm, according to a police report provided to The Independent. The report says Mr Crenshaw stabbed Mr Coronado twice with scissors, which he put back into his waistband before walking away. Mr Coronado's friend told authorities the man who stabbed him had no arms and ran off before they arrived. Mr Crenshaw has lived on South Beach for years, painting for gawking tourists who pay around $60 to watch him work with his feet and take home a canvas. He has been profiled by multiple news outlets, often describing a difficult childhood and family life, though why he does not have his arms remains unknown.",

      "Article": "The art dealer Daniel Elie Bouaziz has been indicted by the Southern District of Florida U.S. Attorney's Office on charges of wire fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering. The disgraced Palm Beach gallerist stands accused of selling cheap reproductions of works by artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Banksy, but telling buyers they were the real deal. The F.B.I. raided one of Bouaziz's Palm Beach galleries, Danieli Fine Art, in December, and police arrested the dealer in May. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years behind bars and a fine of as much as $500,000. Bouaziz's scam allegedly involved flipping inexpensive prints or knockoffs he ordered from websites like LiveAuctioneers and offering them at wildly inflated prices. There was a $495 \"Basquiat\" that he sold for $12 million and a €450 ($485) \"Lichtenstein\" that went for $25,000. Both purchasers were undercover FBI agents, and investigators determined that neither work was an original by the artist. A former member of the now-disbanded Basquiat authentication committee found the piece attributed to the artist to be a fake, while the so-called Lichtenstein had different colors than the work as it appeared in the artist's catalogue raisonné. A fake Jean-Michel Basquiat sold by Daniel Elie Bouaziz for $12 million. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Department of Justice. The dealer provided fake provenance records for each work, and added false edition numbers and artists' signatures to the pieces, according to the indictment. Prospective buyers also allegedly received certificates of authenticity rife with false assertions and appraisals, stamped with a signature block reading \"Daniel Bouaziz, Certified International Fine Art Appraiser.\" Buyers purchased the works at Bouaziz's South Florida galleries, and either picked them up there, had them delivered by hand, or mailed by commercial interstate carrier. The con unraveled when unsatisfied customers began demanding refunds and were unable to get their money back. Bouaziz's two galleries, Danieli Fine Art and Galerie Danieli, both had glitzy exhibition spaces on Worth Avenue, home to a growing number of blue-chip art galleries. News of the dealer's indictment was first reported by ARTnews.",

      "Article": "The mysterious death of a Florida man has been solved, police say, after piecing together an elaborate suicide plot that included a weather balloon hoisting a gun into the sky. Palm Beach Gardens police began investigating the death of Alan Jay Abrahamson as a homicide. His body was found with a bullet wound to his chest in a field near his country club home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, on Jan. 25. Abrahamson, known to carry $200 to $300 in cash, had no cash in his wallet. His watch was missing. Police, who found no weapon or shell casings, began searching for suspects. They did find a pair of small scissors. A $3,000 reward drew no leads. As time went on, police had more questions about what really happened to the well-loved man, \"known for his extraordinary smile, contagious laugh and the twinkle in his eyes,\" according to his obituary in The Palm Beach Post. Surveillance video obtained a few days after the death shows Abrahamson's last moments: Wearing a long-sleeve sweatshirt, blue ball cap, shorts and sneakers, Abrahamson walks off of a sidewalk and off camera. Something was in his left hand. About 37 minutes passes. Then, a gunshot is heard. What happened during those 37 minutes? An email found on Abrahamson's phone suggested he bought a weather balloon on Christmas day of last year. A purchase none of his friends could explain. He didn't have an interest in aerial photographer or meteorology. He also purchased helium tanks. In February, police entertained the idea that Abrahamson's death might have been a suicide. The working theory became: He tied a gun to a string, attached it to the weather balloon, and once the shot was fired, the balloon carried the weapon away from the scene. \"Although the theory seemed far-fetched, it was plausible,\" a police report states. A blood stain on Abrahamson's sweatshirt appeared to support the claim: A long thin line of blood had traveled up — \"indicating that something was in the blood and dragged across to the top of the shirt,\" police note. Investigators dug deep to find any evidence of a case like this in the past. What they found: A \"CSI Las Vegas\" episode from 2003 showing a character who staged a homicide by tying a gun to helium-filled balloons, and the weapon was carried from the scene. Also, a 2008 death in New Mexico appeared to recreate this, but the helium balloons attached to the handle of the gun had become tangled on nearby cactus after the shot was fired. Typed and voiced searches found on Abrahamson's phone also revealed he had researched ways to commit suicide and guns, and various ways a weather balloon could assist. Investigators determined the weather balloon likely burst somewhere north of the Bahamas, in the Atlantic Ocean. The case is closed. Abrahamson worked for a Washington state-based LED lighting company and owned a 5,000-square-foot home in BallenIsles Country Club, The Palm Beach Post reports. His wife, Linda, described her husband as \"the love of her life,\" according to a police report. He was supposed to meet his friend Victor Greenstein that morning in January. Greenstein described Abrahamson to police as \"somebody everybody would gravitate to, and a fun guy that everybody wanted to be around.\"",

The theft happened Saturday afternoon at a Bath and Body Works store in a mall in the Doral suburb west of Miami, investigators said. The unidentified suspect entered the store, filled a bag with candles and then started spraying people with mace. \"This is an only in Miami story,\" Doral Police spokesman Rey Valdes told the Miami Herald. \"You can't make this up.\" About 35 people were affected. Some were taken to hospitals for treatment, including the store manager, but officials were not sure how many or whether any had to be admitted. Bear mace is a strong irritant to a person's eyes and respiratory system. A portion of the mall was evacuated after the macing Saturday. The man believed responsible got away in a cab. The suspect could face numerous armed robbery and aggravated battery charges once he is arrested, Valdes said.",

      "Article": "A Florida man posed as a housewife to trick unsuspecting straight men into letting him perform sex acts on them while he secretly videotaped the encounters to later post online, federal officials said Tuesday. Bryan Deneumostier, 33, of Homestead, was charged with two counts of illegal interception of oral communication and three counts of record-keeping violations in connection with the website \"StraightBoyz,\" the Miami Herald reported, citing a law enforcement document. Deneumostier allegedly ran the website, which featured straight men being tricked into accepting sex acts from gay men, according to the newspaper. The straight men were blindfolded and wore blacked-out goggles and appeared to believe they were with a woman. Deneumostier is accused of posing as a \"real, heterosexual female\" in Craigslist ads to try to lure the men into a home near the Homestead Reserve Air Base, U.S. Homeland Security investigators said. \"When the men ask for assurances that there are no cameras, he assured them that 'she's' married to someone in the army and she would never photograph or video them,\" the Herald reported, citing the law enforcement document. \"In actuality, however, Deneumostier is video and audio taping the entire sexual encounter.\" The man is believed to have run the \"StraightBoyz\" website for four years. The website had more than 600 videos before it was taken offline. It's unclear how many victims there were. Deneumostier was charged with unlawful sex with a minor earlier this month. Police said officers found Deneumostier with an underage boy, who had been reported missing, at a Homestead hotel. Deneumostier reportedly admitted to drugging and having sex with the teen.",

      "Article": "HIALEAH (CBSMiami) - A Hialeah man admitted to police he went \"bananas\" and opened fire on utility trucks in order to stop them from leaving in front of his home. Jorge Jove, 64, who confessed to firing as many as 18 shots into two AT&T work trucks, and allegedly fired at one worker, was released straight from jail on bond Thursday without having to go before a judge. One of the utility workers, from a short distance away, recorded with his cell phone Wednesday as Jove, a retired firefighter, police say, went ballistic, upset that the trucks parked on his front swale and driveway and did not move quickly enough when he asked them to. On the video, you can hear a worker calling 911 as Jove fires over and over again into the trucks, loading his high-powered revolver three times. \"Somebody is up in the bucket right now and they can't come down because he's shooting the truck,\" one of the workers told 911. Arriving police reported that they saw Jove fire at the man in the bucket at the top of a utility pole. Jove was booked on multiple counts of aggravated assault with a firearm. A police report says he told detectives that \"he went bananas and wanted to stop (the workers) from leaving.\" Hours after being arrested Wednesday night, Jove bonded straight out of jail without going before a judge. AT&T workers, near where the shooting occurred, were aghast to learn of his unconditional release. \"That's insane. That's really hard to believe,\" said AT&T worker Michael Martin. He wasn't the only worker who felt that way. \"That doesn't seem like it makes much sense,\" said worker Jeff Reardon. \"I think maybe a psychological evaluation would have been in order.\" Hialeah Police could have put an item on Jove's arrest report directing that he have a bond hearing before a judge, but they didn't. The department's spokesman, Sgt. Carl Zogby, declined to discuss specifics as to why police did not ask that Jove appear before a judge before being released. \"It was a bondable offense. That was our decision, our detectives' decision,\" Zogby said. Had Jove appeared in court, a judge could have attached restrictions to his release, including a requirement that he surrender all weapons he might have. No one was home at Jove's house throughout the day Thursday. The door went unanswered and there were no cars in the drive. But he remains free, somewhere. \"That's crazy,\" said the AT&T worker Reardon, shaking his head.",

He might have fared a lot worse, however, if a good Samaritan walking his dog nearby hadn't been so quick on his feet. Charlie Shannon fashioned a tourniquet out of his dog's leash and used it to staunch the bleeding of a bite wound on the man's leg. Shannon was walking in Halpatiokee Park in Martin County when he heard a commotion nearby. \"Right before the Boy Scout camp I heard some yelling but I didn’t know what it was. I thought it was just kids or something, who knows, but then when I got there I saw it was a pretty serious situation,\" Shannon told WESH. Shannon came across the victim, identified as 74-year-old Palm City resident Robert Bassett, as he was still being attacked by the startled alligator. Basset has been described by friends as an experienced cyclist who knows the trails well. \"The kid held on to me while I reached down and I was able to muscle him out of the water,\" Shannon said. Shannon told the station that he was able to tie a tourniquet using his dog's leash and vague ideas of how to stop the bleeding. \"I just held it tight without trying to cut off the blood too much, because you have to be careful with that, I guess,\" Shannon said. Bassett is currently in stable condition and the alligator has been relocated, per a report from TCPalm.",

Deputies received a complaint about a secret \"internet café\" disguised as a clothing store at the block of 17050 North Highway 301 in Citra. According to the post, an undercover detective visited the establishment and told McNish he was interested in playing some \"tables\".  McNish brought the detective to the back of the business where 16 \"fish game\" stations were located. After using $40 to play the games, the detective determined the games to be simulated gambling devices and promptly left.  Deputies say MCSO units responded to the establishment moments later and detained McNish for questioning, where they say he refused to answer any questions or provide a statement. McNish was arrested and transported to the Marion County Jail on an $8,000 bond.",

Video uploaded to Instagram shows Norwood showing off his best dance moves for the so-called #InMyFeelings Challenge. However, instead of jumping on the hood of a moving car that enters the video, Norwood was hit head on. His Instagram post says, \"Sooo I was originally suppose to jump on the hood of the car, but I slipped. ... Keke never loved me.\" Fortunately, he only suffered a few minor scrapes. The now viral video resulted in Norwood being interviewed by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel Monday night. Norwood told Kimmel that the car, driven by his best friend, wasn't supposed to be traveling that fast. Also, he also slipped on oil in the street, compounding the situation. Despite the infamous video, the Boynton Beach man said he is proud of the notoriety the video has brought him. \"I'm the most famous guy in Florida,\" Norwood told Kimmel. Boynton Beach police said in a tweet they advised: \"Do not try this at home. Or in the middle of the street. Or on a highway. Or riding on top of a car.\"",

      "Article": "HIGHLANDS COUNTY, Fla. - Florida deputies have arrested a man for attempting to perform a castration inside his Highlands County home, WFTS reports. Deputies were called to 74-year-old Gary Van Ryswyk's home located on Orday Road in Sebring on Sunday, August 18. When they arrived, Ryswyk told a deputy he had just performed a castration on a man and encountered major issues. Deputies found a victim on a bed, bleeding heavily, with a towel over his groin. The victim was flown to a nearby hospital and is said to be stable. During their investigation, deputies found two body parts in a pink container, presumed to have belonged to the victim. Ryswyk had set up a room to look like a surgical center and had medical equipment and painkillers inside, according to a release. A camera was also set up to record the procedure. Van Ryswyk told deputies he had met the victim on the dark web on a site geared toward people who have a castration fetish. In addition, Ryswyk told deputies he had tried to perform the procedure on the victim last week, but had to delay. According to a release, Ryswyk told the victim that he had experience on animals and had even removed one of his own testicles in 2012. He also said he had done a similar procedure on a man in a local motel a few years ago. It also did not end well, according to the Highlands County Sheriff's Office. Ryswyk was arrested Monday and charged with practicing medicine without a license resulting in bodily injury, a second-degree felony. His bond was set at $250,000.",

      "Article": "A Florida man has been arrested after he chased down an endangered species and started plucking its feathers. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Jupiter Police department arrested 31-year-old Michael Bochicchio of Jupiter for endangering a threatened species. According to both witnesses and the arrest report, Bochicchio chased down a Sandhill crane, grabbed the bird by its neck, and began removing its feathers. Unfortunately for Michael, Sandhill cranes are on Florida's list of threatened species, which makes it illegal to touch, harass, or remove parts of the species. Witnesses attempted to stop Bochicchio from chasing the crane, however, at one point, Bochicchio even held the plucked feathers in their faces and asked if \"they wanted to keep them\", according to what was told to officers. Bochicchio was arrested and taken to the Palm Beach County Jail.",

      "image": "http://thesmokinggun.com/sites/default/files/assets/biebercutoutlarge.jpg",
      "Article": "A judge has issued an arrest warrant for the 23-year-old man accused of the terribly embarrassing theft of a Justin Bieber cutout from a Florida record store. After defendant David Dowling failed to appear last week for a pretrial conference in Circuit Court, a judge directed sheriff's deputies to arrest him, according to court records docketed Tuesday. Judge Mark Singer also ordered the forfeiture of Dowling's original $120 bond, and ruled that Dowling be held in lieu of $2000 bond when he is rearrested. Dowling was busted in August after he and an underage male crony allegedly swiped the life-size Bieber cutout from an F.Y.E. store in a Bradenton mall. After fleeing the store with the $34.99 Bieber likeness, the pair was busted by security guards who found them \"hiding behind bushes on the exterior of the Mall.\" In a written police statement, an F.Y.E. \"senior assistant manager\" noted, \"As I was coming back from my break the lady from Vitamin World came in to tell me someone stole my 'Bieber Standee.'\" When confronted by cops, Dowling told cops, \"We were just having fun holding Justin Bieber hostage.\" An example of a Bieber cutout is seen above. When collared on the arrest warrant, Dowling will likely face a failure to appear charge (to go along with the original misdemeanor theft count filed against him for nicking the Bieber collectible).",

      "image": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DrWg6uKWsAImpTx?format=jpg&name=small",
      "Article": "A Florida man was arrested on Tuesday, November 6, after visiting the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park after hours the previous night. He caused thousands of dollars in damages and was attacked by a crocodile. The St. Augustine Police Department explained on Facebook that they received a call from a resident on Holly Lane around 6:50 a.m. on Tuesday about a suspicious male, wearing only boxers, crawling on their lawn. The responding officers noticed that the man, who was identified as Brandon Keith Hatfield, was bloody and had injuries on his foot, so they took him to Flagler Hospital for treatment. As the officials were en route to the medical facility, the police department received a call from the Alligator Farm. Staff members had found a single Crocs shoe and various pieces of clothing in one of the crocodile exhibits, and several other exhibits and statues around the park had around $5,000 worth of damages. After reviewing surveillance video, officers soon realized that the man brought to the hospital that morning, Hatfield, was the same guy in the footage. According to the director of the Alligator Farm, John Brueggen, he had illegally entered the property around 7:45 p.m. on Monday, November 5, reported News4JAX. Hatfield walked around the park, causing the damages, and even jumped off of a roof into a pool inhabited by three 12-foot Nile crocodiles. That’s where he was attacked by one of the reptiles. Jay Ruditis of Fuel Productions, the park’s security company, told News4JAX that the surveillance footage revealed that the crocodile had dragged Hatfield and thrashed him around a bit. As he escaped that exhibit, he walked across a fence above more than 200 alligators that were just 12 feet beneath him. He was in the park for about four hours. The results of toxicology reports are still pending, but Dee Brown of the St. Augustine Police Department told First Coast News that \"he was possibly high on something.\" \"It’s a bizarre story, and in 125 years, we never had somebody try swimming with our crocs, and we hope it never happens again,\" Brueggen told News4JAX. \"Our biggest concern is someone tried hurting themselves, and your life is worth more than jumping in with crocs.\" No crocodiles were hurt during the odd incident.",

      "Article": "A Florida Man who identified himself to police as \"Ben Dover\" was arrested on an obstruction charge for providing cops with a phony name, according to a court filing. On Tuesday, a sheriff's deputy asked a man to leave a park in Palm Harbor, a St. Petersburg suburb. In an arrest affidavit, the cop noted that John Chestnut Park closed at 6 PM and, as such, he was preparing to issue a trespass warning to the parkgoer. Asked to identify himself, “\"he defendant responded by stating his name was 'Ben Dover,'\" Deputy K. Baldwin noted. The man then gave the cop the middle finger and got in the deputy's face \"as if he was going to hit him.\" The man then fled on foot, but was apprehended after a short chase. \"Dover,\" as it turned out, was actually Andrew Leighton, a 22-year-old Palm Harbor resident. Seen above, Leighton was charged with two misdemeanors: obstruction by a disguised person and resisting an officer. He was released from the county jail early yesterday morning upon posting $300 bond. Phil McCracken, Heywood Jablome, and Dick Gozinya could not be reached for comment on Leighton's arrest.",

      "Article": "NEW SMYRNA BEACH, Fla.(WESH)  — Police say a naked man ran through the home of an 82-year-old woman and stopped to try on her clothing. Sylvia Garmon said she received the shock of her lifetime when she discovered a naked man running through her home. According to Garmon, the man came through her garage door in New Symrna Beach on Tuesday morning. She confronted the man, whom police identified as Joseph Vaglica, and called 911. After calling 911, Garmon ran to find her stepson, who lives next door to her. Police said Vaglica streaked in and out of Garmon’s home and even tried on a few items of her clothing. Garmon said that Vaglica started banging on the windows and rolling around on the grass. \"He was running around the yard with his arms up,\" she said. Police said it appeared the man was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Vaglica was taken to a hospital and then eventually transported to jail in Volusia County.",

      "Article": "A Florida man allegedly fired his shotgun at rodents dwelling in his backyard after authorities were called to his property on Sunday, police said. Stephen Jonas of Palm Harbor, Florida, allegedly took his .223 rifle and fired off five rounds early Sunday morning, authorities said. At least one bullet struck a neighbor's backyard, according to a statement by Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. No one was injured, police said. Deputies set up a perimeter around Jonas' home and evacuated the neighbors. A Pinellas County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman told ABC News police attempted to use a PA system to get Jonas to come outside and surrender. But Jonas had apparently fallen asleep for eight hours, the spokeswoman told ABC News. The deputies were finally able to connect with Jonas, 51, who was impaired when he \"walked out of his home and was taken into custody without incident,\" according to the police statement. A further search of the home turned up \"many other weapons\" that the spokeswoman described as at least 15 rifles, handguns, one shotgun and 1,300 rounds of ammunition. All were confiscated as evidence, she said. The spokeswoman also said that Jonas possessed more than 30 grams of marijuana and over 30 grams of pills that were believed to be Xanax. While in custody, the spokeswoman confirmed Jonas was \"cooperative\" and allegedly \"told deputies that he was shooting rats in his backyard.\" He faces one count of shooting into an occupied dwelling as well as felony possession of marijuana and felony possession of a controlled substance, the spokeswoman said. He was brought to Pinellas County Jail but posted bail the same day, the spokeswoman said. ABC New' multiple requests for comment to Jonas were not returned.",

      "Article": "Marion County, Fla. - A Florida man has been arrested for having sex with a miniature horse on multiple occasions, deputies say. According to the Marion County Sheriff's Office, 21-year-old Nicholas Anthony Sardo, of Citra, has been arrested and charged with four counts of bestiality/sexual contact with an animal. Deputies say that on October 16, a witness came forward and reported that she had witnessed Sardo having sex with a miniature male pony named Jackie G in a pasture on a family member's property three days earlier. Another witness came forward saying she saw it as well, and she approached Sardo about what she had seen, according to the sheriff's office. Sardo immediately admitted to her that he had sex with the horse and also gave the same admission to a detective investigating the allegation. Sardo added that he had sex with the horse four times during the course of a week, according to the detective. The sheriff's office stated in a press release that, \"he used a condom each time because he didn't want to get a disease from the horse.\" Additionally, Sardo told the detective that he knew he was wrong for what he did and that, \"he was a sick man,\" according to the sheriff's office. One of Sardo's family members is the owner of the horse and the horse is currently under their care. Stipulations of Sardo’s future contact with the horse could be determined by a judge in the near future. Sardo is currently being held in the Marion County Jail.",

Pictured in the mug shot at right, Bowers was arrested last month following a confrontation with his 51-year-old girlfriend. The woman alleged that Bowers dragged her through his Bonita Springs residence, kicked her in the face, and pushed her out of the house. Bowers, who denied striking his girlfriend, told deputies that the dispute began after the couple went to bed. He said that he \"became angry when he woke up\" and saw that his girlfriend had a \"big dildo between her legs,\" according to a Lee County Sheriff's Office report. He added that he told the woman to \"cut that shit out and let him sleep.\" Bowers spent two weeks in jail before bonding out last week. He is next due in court on December 20.",

      "Article": "A Florida sandwich connoisseur has become the subject of a manhunt after stealing a foot-long sub, which he proceeded to hide down the front of his pants. The as-yet-unidentified thief stole the snack from a gas station in the city of Lakeland on November 25, according to the local Channel 8 News station. On Monday, the Polk County Sheriff's Office released CCTV images of the foot-long fan in a bid to identify him. A post on the office's Facebook page explained that the theft occurred at around 8:45 p.m., before the suspect escaped on a bike. The images posted on the Facebook page show a white male wearing beige pants, a blue sweatshirt and a white backward-facing cap. He can be seen clearly tucking the sandwich into his waistband while keeping his eyes forward, presumably on a cashier or other member of staff. \"A sandwich thief walks among us,\" the Facebook appeal explained, describing the audacious heist as a \"sub crime.\" The office urged anyone with information to contact Detective J. Leblanc. \"Some of you may think we're overdoing it by trying to identify the suspect of a relatively minor theft...one of you is probably even saying, 'This is small potatoes!' And to that we would reply, \"No..this was a foot long sandwich, not potatoes. Pay attention!\" the police appeal read. \"Too bad it wasn't a hot sandwich—that would have provided instant Karma to the pilferer,\" the post added. Deputies explained that the man bought a Polar Pop—presumably as cover—after shoving the sandwich down his front, and then left the store. \"The suspect fled on a bicycle in an unknown direction, perhaps in search for chips to steal,\" police added. \"We hope to identify this suspect so he can be caught and pay for his crime. This should also serve as notice to all as to why you do not take food from a stranger. You don't know where it's been.\"",

The incident was captured on surveillance cameras. His mother, Corrine Hatfield, said she first learned of the incident on the news. \"Thank God for y'all covering the story,\" Hatfield said. \"If not, we would never have found out.\" Hatfield said her son did break into the farm while high, but ending up in the crocodile pit was an accident. \"He was trying to get out,\" Hatfield said. \"He didn't know he was on the roof and fell,\" Hatfield said. Security cameras captured a crocodile biting her son. Hatfield said the foot will have to be amputated if doctors can't get control of the infection. She said her son's mistake is due to a lack of resources for those struggling with drug addiction. When asked what she hoped the future would look like for her son, Hatfield said, \"For Brandon to get help with his drug rehab.\"",

After being provided with an explanation by a deputy, Wach claimed that he \"shoots in the yard all the time.\" And, as for fighting with his 18-year-old son, Wach remarked that, \"fighting is what redneck people do.\" That unique explanation did not sway deputies, who charged Wach with domestic battery and aggravated domestic assault with a firearm.",

A southwest Florida woman shared cellphone footage with Fort Myers television station NBC-2 of the man yelling during the Cape Coral Festival of Lights on Saturday night. Cape Coral police told the station that officers were at the event but couldn't do anything because the man was exercising his freedom of speech. They added they could have intervened had he used a voice enhancer, such as a megaphone, or started a riot. Cindy Menkes of Cape Coral says it's about decency and said she's sad that \"the magic of this time of year\" was taken away from some children.",

Thankfully, this one is a bit less dire than that whole robber-devoured-by-an-alligator thing from earlier. The Naples Daily News reports that Florida Man Noe Dejesus, 33, has been charged with a DUI after he was pulled over at 3 PM Saturday while driving 110 MPH in a Cadillac with three women while completely naked. Editor's note: Driving drunk is not, nor will it ever be, funny. Police initially noticed that Dejesus was not wearing a shirt, and that there was a 12-pack of Corona in the front seat. When the troopers asked him to step out of the car, he \"nearly fell,\" and revealed himself to be fully nude. He was also slurring his speech and smelled of alcohol. Upon searching the car, police found several beer bottles, empty or nearly empty, and a just-about-cached bottle of Crown Royal. Nothing says Florida Man like a mid-afternoon naked-with-three-women drunken high-speed joyride in a Cadillac. Also, it happened on Alligator Alley.",

Harrison told the dispatcher he wanted police to contact him. An officer called and got directions to his storage unit. Police found 150 grams of cultivated marijuana and nine plants inside. Harrison faces charges of growing marijuana within 1,000 feet of a school and intent to sell. It's not known if he has a lawyer.",

As the driver spoke with cops, Clark allegedly \"pulled out a piece of paper towel from her crotch\" that had three Oxycodone pills and three Xanax tablets. Clark, pictured in the mug shot at right, then denied that the drugs she fished from the vicinity of her private parts were her property, according to a police report excerpted here. She pointed the finger at the driver, alleging that he \"told her to put it down her pants.\" The driver denied Clark's claim, stating \"he has no idea what was down her pants.\" Clark's disavowal of the stash in her drawers was rejected by cops, who charged her with two felony drug possession counts. She is being held in the Manatee County jail in lieu of $2000 bond. In late-September, a Florida man gave police a similar story when they discovered a bag of cocaine hidden inside his buttocks. Strangely, the suspect admitted ownership of a bag of pot that was also wedged in the same place.",

      "Article": "TAMPA — Hours before his Northdale rental went up in flames, investigators say Patrick O'Brien, lead guitarist for the death metal band Cannibal Corpse, called relatives warning about \"the rapture\" and that \"aliens have landed.\" The next day, after the fire subsided, fire marshals found a large cache of weapon, locked safes and potential explosive devices inside the home the 53-year-old O'Brien rented at 16311 Northwood Dr. The stash included about 50 shotguns - including one with a barrel illegaly sawed off to about an inch past the stock - 10 semiautomatic rifles including a couple of AK-47 variants, two Uzi-style rifles and 20 handguns, according to a search warrant. Authorities even found two flame throwers, according to the warrant, one inside the house and one outside of it. The warrant reveals the backdrop to the chaos of that Dec. 10 night, when the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said O'Brien broke into a neighbor's house and then charged a deputy with a knife before he was repeatedly stunned with a Taser then arrested. Then his home caught fire, and firefighters had to retreat as the ammunition inside started to explode. Rounding out what investigators said they seized from inside the charred home were thousands of rounds of ammunition - stored in boxes, military-style metal cans and even ammunition belts - several other weapons and weapons' parts and three skulls. Local authorities called in federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to help with the investigation. With the exception of the sawed-off shotgun, it is not illegal to possess such weapons. But the warrant does not say whether O'Brien had the proper paperwork for his cache. O'Brien's arrest report details how the chaos started: He entered a home in the 4700 block of Windflower Circle just before 7 p.m. O'Brien didn't know anyone at the home and didn't have permission to be there, the report said, but when the two residents inside the home asked him to leave he ignored them and shouted that \"the rapture is coming.\" Then he pushed a woman in the home to the ground and ran to the backyard, the report said. The couple called 911 and when deputies arrived they found O'Brien hiding behind a fence near the backyard. A deputy reported giving O'Brien \"multiple commands\" to surrender before he lunged at the deputy with a knife. O'Brien was stunned multiple times with an electroshock device, then handcuffed. Then flames were spotted at his house. O'Brien was booked into the Hillsborough County jail on charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and burglary of an occupied dwelling with assault. When O'Brien made his first appearance in court before a judge on Dec. 11, he was ordered to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation before his release. That condition was removed on Dec. 12, records show. Then on Friday, he was freed after posting $50,000 bail. O'Brien did not return calls for comment. His mother, Nancy O'Brien, declined to comment. Cannibal Corpse was formed in 1988 in Buffalo, N.Y., and launched their career with an album recorded at Morrisound Studios in Temple Terrace. The band has released 14 albums, according to its website, with song titles such as \"Bloodstained Cement\" and \"Icepick Lobotomy.\" Last week, Andy Turner and Nikki Law from Cannibal Corpse's management team at Metal Blade Records declined to comment to the Tampa Bay Times about the incident. O'Brien was arrested the day after the band announced it would be the opening act for legendary thrash metal band Slayer on the North American leg of their farewell tour. Cannibal Corpse band members and management have not commented publicly on how O'Brien's arrest could affect their spot on the tour. Slayer's Final Tour is slated to stop at the MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre in Tampa on May 10.",

      "Article": "A Florida man arrested while driving a scooter packed with meth and coke claimed the drugs were left behind by the vehicle's previous owner, telling a deputy he \"didn’t know what to do with them,\" authorities said. Jesus Giovanni Ginjauma, 21, was stopped in Key Largo Community Park on Sunday while driving a green Yamaha scooter that had a license plate obscured by spray paint, according to an arrest report obtained by the Miami Herald. Ginjauma told the deputy he didn't have a license, claiming he paid necessary fines to have it restored but found the Department of Motor Vehicles office closed when he tried to submit the paperwork. The deputy later found out that Ginjauma's license had been suspended four times this year. The deputy then asked Ginjauma if he had anything illegal in his possession, prompting him to admit having six bags of cocaine and another bag of meth. The drugs had been in the scooter when Ginjauma bought it from a man in Plantation Key, he claimed, and told the deputy there was more under the seat. \"Jesus told me that he had bought the scooter from [the man] the day before and that he had found the drugs in the scooter and didn't know what to do with them,\" Deputy Benjamin Elmore wrote. \"Jesus told me that [the previous owner] had left town the day before.\" The deputy then found an unlabeled, 16-ounce bottle of promethazine hydrochloride, a prescription sedative, inside the scooter's seat compartment. He also found a digital scale, clear baggies and a cardboard pipe with marijuana residue. A backup deputy later found a second bag of cocaine hidden in the scooter's gas cap door, according to a sheriff's office spokeswoman. Ginjauma is being held on $49,000 bail on charges of possession with intent to sell cocaine, possession of a controlled substance without a prescription, possession of drug equipment and driving with a suspended license.",

On Monday, contractors boarded up the businesses. Mores said the tax and casket offices were empty when the car smashed through the building. Police said the driver told them he was trying to \"travel through time.\" \"I was mad, then eventually I was happy no one was hurt. You know, that was my biggest concern 'cause, you know, if anyone was hurt, anybody could have died or whatever,\" Mores said. Mores said the tax office will move next door to 3844 Alcaniz St. and the casket business will move to 3842. Both businesses said they hope to be open after Christmas. Pensacola police said the driver has been issued a citation for reckless driving and is in the hospital for evaluation.",

      "Article": "James A. Mucciaccio Jr., of Deerfield Beach, was identified as the Florida man who drove his Ferrari 360 into the Palm Beach Inlet the day after Christmas. The driver was reportedly racing his Ferrari at top speed before launching himself and his vehicle into the Atlantic Ocean. According to local NBC station WPTV 5 that broke the news earlier in the week – citing reports from both the local fire department and the Palm Beach police department – it was around 7 a.m. on December 26 when the oceanic crash occurred. Mucciaccio and his Ferrari reportedly took flight before landing in the ocean. The vehicle proceeded to float for nearly 50 feet before it began to submerge. Mucciaccio was able to escape the vehicle without injuries before it reached the ocean floor – sinking roughly 30 feet. According to the media outlet, divers were able to inflate the vehicle's airbags and float the vehicle back to the surface before pulling it out of the water. The Ferrari was retrieved within 24 hours of the time it first hit the water. The crash report reveals the driver did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident. The reports did indicate that Mucciaccio intentionally drove his vehicle at top speed before catapulting it off of the dock and into the ocean. According to Cars.com, depending on the condition and the year of the vehicle he drove into the ocean, a Ferrari 360 can be worth anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000.",

      "Article": "The new year has officially been saved! Hillsborough deputies recovered more than half a million dollars of Patron Tequila Sunday night in Thonotosassa. Deputies say a truck was hauling a load with 966 cases of tequila worth $507,105 when the driver stopped for dinner at a Tampa truck stop around 11 p.m. on U.S. Highway 301. When the driver came back to his truck, he noticed his trailer was no longer attached. Deputies searched for the stolen tequila and found the semi-trailer around 12:30 a.m. near the intersection of Smith Road and McIntosh Road. Four men were transferring the tequila to a box truck registered to them, according to deputies, and 20 cases were already taken from the trailer when authorities moved in. Three suspects were arrested without any trouble. Deputies say they were Vidal Estrada, 66, Humberto Ramirez, 37, and Alberto Obaya, 46. The fourth suspect, later identified as Lemuel Escobar, allegedly tried to run from the scene, but was found and arrested nearby on McIntosh Road. All four suspects face burglary and grand theft charges with a value over $100,000 or more and resisting an officer without violence. Obaya also faces charges of possession of a controlled substance. The case is still under investigation. Cheers to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office for recovering the alcohol!",
